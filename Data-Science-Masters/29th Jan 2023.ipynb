    "3. Loops: Loops are blocks of code that repeat a set of instructions for a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met. There are two main types of loops in Python: \"for\" loops and \"while\" loops.\n",
    "4. Conditional statements: Conditional statements are blocks of code that execute a set of instructions based on a condition. The two main types of conditional statements in Python are \"if\" statements and \"if-else\" statements.\n",
    "5. Try-except blocks: Try-except blocks are blocks of code used to handle exceptions (errors) that may occur during the execution of a program. The \"try\" block contains the code that may raise an exception, and the \"except\" block contains the code that will be executed if an exception occurs.\n",
