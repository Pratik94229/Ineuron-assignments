    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.  An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception is encountered, Python raises an object that represents the type of error that occurred, along with a message that describes the nature of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as invalid input, insufficient memory, or division by zero. Python provides built-in exception classes for common types of errors, such as ValueError, TypeError, and ZeroDivisionError, and also allows developers to define their own custom exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors occur when the code violates the syntax rules of the Python language. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing stage, before the program is actually executed. Syntax errors typically result from missing or incorrect keywords, operators, or punctuation, and are easy to fix once identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program is executed, while exceptions occur during program execution. Syntax errors can be fixed by correcting the syntax error in the code, while exceptions are often caused by runtime errors and require additional handling to prevent the program from crashing.\n",

    "Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",

    "\n",
    "The try statement is used to enclose a block of code that may raise an exception.
