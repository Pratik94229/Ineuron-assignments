    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, the built-in open() function is used to open a file. This function takes two arguments: the name of the file to be opened, and the mode in which the file should be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"r\" (read mode): This mode is used to read data from an existing file. If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"w\" (write mode): This mode is used to write data to a file. If the file already exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\" (append mode): This mode is used to append data to an existing file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"x\" (exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to create a new file, but only if it does not already exist. If the file already exists, a FileExistsError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"b\" (binary mode): This mode is used to read or write binary data, such as images or other non-text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"t\" (text mode): This mode is used to read or write text data, which is the default mode if no mode is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"+\" (read and write mode): This mode is used to allow both reading and writing to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When opening a file, the mode argument is a string that contains one or more of the above mode characters. For example, to open a file named \"example.txt\" for reading in text mode, you would use the following code:\n",

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "The close() function is used to close an open file in Python. It's important to close a file after we've finished working with it because it frees up system resources that were being used by the file, such as memory and open file handles.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don't close a file properly after we're done working with it, it can lead to a number of problems. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory leaks: When we open a file, the operating system allocates memory to store information about the file, such as its size and location on disk. If we don't close the file properly, this memory may not be released, which can cause memory leaks and potentially slow down our program or even crash it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data corruption: If we're writing to a file and don't close it properly, some of the data we wrote may not be saved to disk. This can lead to data corruption, which can cause serious problems if we're working with important data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource conflicts: If we have multiple programs or processes that are accessing the same file, failing to close the file properly can cause resource conflicts, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these problems, it's important to always close files properly after we're done working with them. In Python, we can close a file using the close() method, like this:\n",
